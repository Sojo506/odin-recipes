# Odin Recipes

A basic recipe website built as part of the *Foundations* course from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

## Project Description

Odin Recipes is a simple static website that contains a main index page with links to individual recipe pages.  
Each recipe page includes a title, an image, a description, a list of ingredients, and preparation steps.  

The goal of this project is to practice working with **HTML structure and page linking**. Later in the course, CSS will be added to style the website.
