        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>Add mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach to the skillet. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes.
            Season with salt, pepper, basil, and oregano.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine crumbled tofu with a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well to create a tofu ricotta
            texture.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Layer 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of tofu ricotta, followed by a layer of cooked
            vegetables, and then a layer of marinara sauce. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending
            with a layer of marinara sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle vegan mozzarella cheese over the top layer.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an
            additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
