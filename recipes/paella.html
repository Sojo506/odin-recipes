        <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp saffron threads</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup artichoke hearts, quartered (canned or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 cup peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Your choice of protein (chickpeas, tofu, or tempeh for a vegan option)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, soak the saffron threads in 1/4 cup of warm vegetable broth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or paella pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and
            saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the diced red bell pepper and cook for another 3-4 minutes until slightly tender.</li>
        <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat the rice with the oil and vegetables. Cook for 2-3
            minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Pour in the remaining vegetable broth and the saffron-infused broth. Stir in the smoked paprika, salt,
            and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 15 minutes, stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the green beans, artichoke hearts, cherry tomatoes, peas, and your choice of protein to the pan.
            Continue to cook for another 10-15 minutes until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid.
            If needed, add a bit more broth or water to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked and the vegetables are tender, remove from heat. Cover the pan with a clean
            kitchen towel and let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with lemon wedges before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade paella!</li>
